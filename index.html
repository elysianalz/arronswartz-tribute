		<h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			<strong>Aaron Hillel Swartz (November 8, 1986 – January 11, 2013)</strong> was an American computer programmer, entrepreneur, writer, political organizer, and Internet hacktivist. He was involved in the development of the web feed format <em>RSS</em> and the Markdown publishing format, the organization <em>Creative Commons</em>, the website framework <em>web.py</em>, and the social news site <em>Reddit</em>, in which he became a partner after its merger with his company, <em>Infogami</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Swartz's work also focused on civic awareness and activism. He helped launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee in 2009 to learn more about effective online activism. In 2010, he became a research fellow at Harvard University's Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption, directed by Lawrence Lessig. He founded the online group Demand Progress, known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2011, <strong>Swartz was arrested by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</strong> police on state breaking-and-entering charges, after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet, and setting it to download academic journal articles systematically from JSTOR using a guest user account issued to him by MIT. Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release.
		</p>
		<p>
			Swartz declined a plea bargain under which he would have served six months in federal prison. Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, where he had hanged himself.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>In 2013, Swartz was inducted posthumously into the Internet Hall of Fame.</strong>

		<h1>LIFE AND WORKS</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			<strong>Swartz was born in Highland Park, Illinois</strong> (a suburb of Chicago), the eldest son of Jewish parents Susan and Robert Swartz and brother of Noah and Benjamin. His father had founded the software firm Mark Williams Company. Swartz immersed himself in the study of computers, programming, the Internet, and Internet culture. He attended North Shore Country Day School, a small private school near Chicago, until 9th grade. Swartz left high school in the 10th grade, and enrolled in courses at a Chicago area college.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>At age 13</strong>, Swartz won an ArsDigita Prize, given to young people who create "useful, educational, and collaborative" noncommercial websites. At age 14, he became a member of the working group that authored the RSS 1.0 web syndication specification. Aaron was a frequent blogger in which he wrote about various things such as his experiences at Stanford, his role in creating Creative Commons, copyright law, and an assortment of other topics.

		<h1>Entrepreneurship</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			<strong>Swartz attended Stanford University.</strong> During his freshman year, Swartz applied to Y Combinator's very first Summer Founders Program proposing to work on a startup called Infogami designed as a flexible content management system to allow the creation of rich and visually interesting websites or a form of wiki for structured data. After working on Infogami with co-founder Simon Carstensen over the summer of 2005, Aaron opted not to return to Stanford, choosing instead to continue to develop and seek funding for Infogami.
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of his work on Infogami, Swartz created the web.py web application framework because he was unhappy with other available systems in the Python programming language. In early fall of 2005, Swartz worked with the founders of another nascent Y-Combinator firm Reddit, to rewrite their Lisp codebase using Python and web.py. Although Infogami's platform was abandoned after Not A Bug was acquired, Infogami's software was used to support the Internet Archive's Open Library project and the web.py web framework was used as basis for many other projects by Swartz and many others
		</p>
		<p>
			When Infogami failed to find further funding, Y-Combinator organizers suggested that Infogami merge with Reddit, which it did in November 2005 to form a new firm Not A Bug devoted to promoting both products. Although both projects initially struggled to gain traction, Reddit began to make large gains in popularity in 2005 and 2006.
		</p>
		<p>
			n October 2006, based largely on the success of Reddit, Not A Bug was acquired by Condé Nast Publications, the owner of Wired magazine. Swartz moved with his company to San Francisco to work on Wired. Swartz found office life uncongenial, and he ultimately left the company.
		</p>
		<p>
			In September 2007, Swartz joined with Infogami co-founder Simon Carstensen to launch a new firm Jottit in another attempt to create another markdown driven content management system in Python

		<h1>Activism</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			<strong>In 2008, Swartz founded Watchdog.net</strong>, "the good government site with teeth," to aggregate and visualize data about politicians. In the same year, he wrote a widely circulated Guerilla Open Access Manifesto.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of his more notorious works that supports activism is <strong>Deaddrop</strong>, now renamed to SecureDrop, a platform for secure communication between journalists and sources (whistleblowers) used at several news organizations, including <em>ProPublica</em>, <em>The Intercept</em>, <em>The Guardian</em>, and <em>The Washington Post</em>.
